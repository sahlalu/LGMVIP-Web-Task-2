# LGMVIP-Web-Task-2

Hello



During my LGMVIP Web Developer Internship, I successfully tackled Beginner Level - Task 2. Using React, I crafted a Navbar featuring a brand name and a 'Get Users' button. Clicking the button triggered an API call, enabling the display of fetched user data within the app interface.



Here are Explained Features:

1. First You will see a Navbar containing Brand Name and "Get Users" Button.

2. User Clicks On "Get Users" Button Which Calls an Api to Get A User Data.

3. After Clicking It Loads The Data and it also shows a "Loading..." loader while fetching Data. And shows the data.

4. I used CSS for styling the components.
